# Recipe App

## Project Description

The Recipe App is a web application designed to help users find and explore a variety of recipes. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integration, the app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for searching and displaying detailed recipes. 

### Key Features

- **Search Functionality:** Users can input the name of any recipe they are interested in. The app then displays a variety of options related to the search query.
- **Detailed Recipe Information:** Each search result includes a "View" button. When clicked, a pop-up window appears, showcasing the ingredients and step-by-step process for making the selected recipe.
- **User Experience:** The app is designed to be responsive and easy to navigate, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in front-end development, including dynamic content fetching and user interaction handling using JavaScript and APIs.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS:** For styling the application.
